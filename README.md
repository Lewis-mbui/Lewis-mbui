# Hi, I'm Lewis 👋

I'm someone who enjoys learning how things work and taking the time to understand concepts properly. Over the past several months, I've been exploring web development and building small projects while strengthening my problem-solving skills step by step.

I like keeping things simple, focusing on the fundamentals, and improving a little every day.
